The visualization elegantly demonstrates how Euclidean geometry focuses on distances and angles, while Affine geometry preserves parallelism and ratios but not necessarily distances or angles. The interactive nature lets you explore these concepts hands-on!
Run it and drag the points around - you'll see how the geometric relationships change dynamically while maintaining their respective invariants. Pure mathematical elegance in motion!
